	 * _instance volatile, as another thread can see a half initialized instance

		 * Without volatile modifier it's possible for another thread in Java to
		 * see half initialized state of _instance variable, but with volatile
		 * variable guaranteeing happens-before relationship, all the write will
		 * happen on volatile _instance before any read of _instance variable.
		 * 
		 * This was not the case prior to Java 5, and that's why double checked
		 * locking was broken before. Now, with happens-before guarantee, you
		 * can safely assume that this will work.
		 * 
		 * By the way this is not the best way to create thread-safe Singleton,
		 * you can use Enum as Singleton, which provides inbuilt thread-safety
		 * during instance creation. Another way is to use static holder
		 * pattern.
